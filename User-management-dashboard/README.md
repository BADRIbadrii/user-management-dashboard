This is a simple User Management Dashboard that allows you to add, edit, and delete user information. The project includes a user interface with a modal form for adding/editing users and displays a list of users with their details. All data is stored temporarily in the browser's memory.

Components:

index.html: This file contains the structure and layout of the User Management Dashboard, including the modal form for adding and editing users.

styles.css: The CSS file that handles the styling for the page, the modal, and the user list. It includes styles for layout, buttons, and form inputs.

script.js: Contains the JavaScript that powers the functionality of the application, such as adding users, editing users, and deleting users from the list.

Challenges Faced:

Modal Behavior: Ensuring the modal appears and closes correctly was a challenge, especially making sure that the form resets when opening in "Add New User" mode and pre-fills data when editing an existing user.

Dynamic Data Handling: Since the user data is stored temporarily in the browser (using JavaScript arrays), managing state effectively and ensuring the UI reflects the changes immediately was important.

Responsiveness: Making sure the modal and user list are responsive and look good on different screen sizes was tricky but manageable using basic CSS layout techniques like flexbox.


Potential Improvements:

Persistent Storage: The current implementation does not save data persistently. It would be an improvement to save user data to a local database (like SQLite or Firebase) or in the browserâ€™s local storage so that data persists across page reloads.

User Validation: Adding form validation (for example, checking if the email is valid or ensuring that no fields are empty) would improve the usability and robustness of the application.

Styling Enhancements: The current design is simple and could be improved by adding animations, transitions for the modal, or a more modern UI library (like Bootstrap or Material UI).

Search and Filtering: It would be helpful to allow users to filter or search the list of users by their name, email, or department.

Unit Testing: Adding unit tests to ensure the JavaScript functions (such as adding/editing users) work as expected would be a good improvement for future scalability.
